## Summary
Blocks certain messages from being displayed in chat to prevent spam. Especially useful on deathmatch servers. There were a lot of complaints on other plugins not working properly, so that's why i decided to create a functional one.

## Requirements
* A CS2 server with [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=master) and [CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp)[^1] installed

## Installation
1. Download ChatMessageBlocker
2. Unpack the downloaded files and upload them to your server like you would with any other plugin
3. Restart your server to load the plugin

## To Do
- [ ] Add a configuration file to toggle certain messages
- [ ] Merge [AcronymsReplacer](https://github.com/LadderGeit/LG-CSS-Acronyms-Replacer)[^2] and this together to eventually create an AIO Message Manager
- [ ] Include server console messages to avoid _"useless"_ spam messages.


## Changelog
> [!NOTE]
> For the people who can't be bothered doing the research.

### v1.0.0
* Initial release

[^1]: Tested on v201 for reference.
[^2]: Plugin is currently private and interfering with other chat managing plugins.
